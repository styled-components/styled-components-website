      styled-components utilises tagged template literals to style your components.

    <p>
      It removes the mapping between components and styles. This means that when you're defining your styles,
      you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example creates two simple components, a wrapper and a title, with some styles attached to it.
      You can edit the code and get a feel for how you'd work with styled-components.

    <Note>
      The CSS rules are automatically vendor prefixed, so you don't have to think about it.
