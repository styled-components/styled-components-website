  ## Animations

  CSS animations with \`@keyframes\` aren't scoped to a single component but you still don't want them
  to be global. This is why we export a \`keyframes\` helper which will generate a unique name for your
  keyframes. You can then use that unique name throughout your app.

  This way, you get all the benefits of using JavaScript, are avoiding name clashes and get your keyframes
  like always:

  \`\`\`jsx
  import { keyframes } from "styled-components";
  // keyframes returns a unique name based on a hash of the contents of the keyframes
  const rotate360 = keyframes\`
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }

    to {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
  \`;

  // Here we create a component that will rotate everything we pass in over two seconds
  const Rotate = styled.div\`
    display: inline-block;
    animation: \${rotate360} 2s linear infinite;
    padding: 2rem 1rem;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  \`;

  render(
    <Rotate>&lt; ðŸ’… &gt;</Rotate>
  );
  \`\`\`
`

export default Animations
