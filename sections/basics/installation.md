## Installation

Install styled-components from npm:

```bash
npm install --save styled-components
```

> Want to try out the new styled-components v4 beta? It's available now via:

> ```bash
> npm install --save styled-components@beta
> ```

It's highly recommended (but not required) to also use the [styled-components babel plugin](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components). It offers many benefits like more legible class names, server-side rendering compatibility, smaller bundles, and more.

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-styled-components
```

Then make sure the "styled-components" plugin is added to your `.babelrc`.

```json
{
  "presets": ["env", "react"],
  "plugins": ["styled-components"]
}
```

> If you don't already have babel set up in your project, their website has an [installation instructions tool](https://babeljs.io/en/setup).
