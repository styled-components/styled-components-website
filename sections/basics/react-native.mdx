## React Native

styled-components can be used with React Native in the same way and with the
same import. Try this example with [Snack by Expo](https://snack.expo.dev/@danielmschmidt/styled-components).

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components/native'

const StyledView = styled.View`
  background-color: papayawhip;
`

const StyledText = styled.Text`
  color: #BF4F74;
`

class MyReactNativeComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <StyledView>
        <StyledText>Hello World!</StyledText>
      </StyledView>
    )
  }
}
```

We also support more complex styles (like `transform`), which would normally
be an array, and shorthands (e.g. for `margin`) thanks to
[`css-to-react-native`](https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native)!

> Note that the `flex` property works like CSS shorthand, and not the legacy
> `flex` property in React Native. Setting `flex: 1` sets `flexShrink`
> to `1` in addition to setting `flexGrow` to `1` and `flexBasis` to `0`.

Imagine how you'd write the property in React Native, guess how you'd transfer
it to CSS, and you're probably right:

```tsx
const RotatedBox = styled.View`
  transform: rotate(90deg);
  text-shadow-offset: 10px 5px;
  font-variant: small-caps;
  margin: 5px 7px 2px;
`
```

Some of the differences to the web-version are, that you cannot use the
`keyframes` and `createGlobalStyle` helpers since React Native doesn't support
keyframes or global styles. We will also warn you if you use media queries or
nest your CSS.

> In v2 we support percentages. To make this possible we need to enforce units
> for all shorthands. If you're migrating to v2,
> [a codemod is available](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components-native-code-mod).

### Simpler usage with the metro bundler

If you'd prefer to just import `styled-components` instead of `styled-components/native`, you can add a [`resolverMainFields` configuration](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/configuration#resolvermainfields) that includes `"react-native"`. This used to be supported in metro by default (and currently does work in haul) but appears to have been removed at some point.

## Expo

styled-components can be used in an [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) project the same way in a React Native project for native platforms.

### Usage with Expo and Next.js

Using Expo and Next.js to create a [universal app](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/) is a bit different. You'll need to apply the React Native aliases manually. This is done by `@expo/webpack-config` (which is in [`@expo/next-adapter`](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/packages/next-adapter#readme)).

- Add `@expo/next-adapter` to your project:

```sh
npx @expo/next-adapter
```

- Install the styled-components Babel plugin:

```sh
$ npm install -D babel-plugin-styled-components
```

- Use the Babel plugin in your **babel.config.js** file:

```diff
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@expo/next-adapter/babel'],
+ plugins: [['styled-components', { ssr: true }]]
}
```

Now you can use `styled-components/native` just like in a regular Expo project!

### Tree-Shaking

styled-components imports all of `react-native-web` which [breaks React Native web tree-shaking](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/2797#issuecomment-574955289). This means your bundle size will be larger and include all of the components exported from `react-native-web`.
