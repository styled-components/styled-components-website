## Adapting based on props

You can pass a function ("interpolations") to a styled component's template literal
to adapt it based on its props.

This button component has a primary state that changes its colour.
When setting the <Code>primary</Code> prop to true, we are swapping out its background and text colour.

```react
const Button = styled.button`
  /* Adapt the colours based on primary prop */
  background: ${props => props.primary ? "palevioletred" : "white"};
  color: ${props => props.primary ? "white" : "palevioletred"};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

render(
  <div>
    <Button>Normal</Button>
    <Button primary>Primary</Button>
  </div>
);
```
