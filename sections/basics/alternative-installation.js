  ## Alternative Installation

  If you're not using a module bundler or package manager we also have a global ("UMD") build hosted on the [unpkg](http://unpkg.com) CDN. Simply add the following \`<script>\` tag to the bottom of your HTML file:

  ~~~
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js"></script>
  ~~~

  Once you've added \`styled-components\` you will have access to the global \`window.styled\` variable.

  > This style of usage requires the [react CDN bundles](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) to be on the page as well.
