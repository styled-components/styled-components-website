## Server Side Rendering | v2+

styled-components supports concurrent server side rendering, with stylesheet rehydration.
The basic idea is that everytime you render your app on the server, you can create
a `ServerStyleSheet` and add a provider to your React tree, that accepts styles
via a context API.

This doesn't interfere with global styles, such as `keyframes` or `injectGlobal` and
allows you to use styled-components with React DOM's SSR, or even Rapscallion.

The basic API goes as follows:

```jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
const html = renderToString(sheet.collectStyles(<YourApp />))
const styleTags = sheet.getStyleTags() // or sheet.getStyleElement();
```

The `collectStyles` method wraps your element in a provider. Optionally you can use
the `StyleSheetManager` provider directly, instead of this method. Just make sure not to
use it on the client-side.

```jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { ServerStyleSheet, StyleSheetManager } from 'styled-components'

const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
const html = renderToString(
  <StyleSheetManager sheet={sheet.instance}>
    <YourApp />
  </StyleSheetManager>,
)

const styleTags = sheet.getStyleTags() // or sheet.getStyleElement();
```

The `sheet.getStyleTags()` returns a string of multiple `<style>` tags.
You need to take this into account when adding the CSS string to your HTML output.

Alternatively the `ServerStyleSheet` instance also has a `getStyleElement()` method
that returns an array of React elements.

> `sheet.getStyleTags()` and `sheet.getStyleElement()` can only be called after your element is rendered. As a result, components from `sheet.getStyleElement()` cannot be combined with `<YourApp />` into a larger component.

You should install and use our babel plugin with its `ssr` option turned on.
This prevents checksum mismatches by adding a deterministic ID to each styled component.
Refer to the [tooling documentation](/docs/tooling#serverside-rendering) for more information.

### Next.js

Basically you need to add a custom `pages/_document.js` (if you don't have one). Then
[copy the logic](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components/pages/_document.js)
for styled-components to inject the server side rendered styles into the `<head>`.

Refer to [our example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components) in the Next.js repo for an up-to-date usage example.

### Streaming Rendering

styled-components offers a streaming API for use with [ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertonodestream). There are two parts to a streaming implementation:

_On the server:_

`ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream` emits a "readable" stream that styled-components wraps. As whole chunks of HTML are pushed onto the stream, if any corresponding styles are ready to be rendered, a style block is prepended to React's HTML and forwarded on to the client browser.

```js
import { renderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/server'
import styled, { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

// if you're using express.js, you'd have access to the response object "res"

// typically you'd want to write some preliminary HTML, since React doesn't handle this
res.write('<html><head><title>Test</title></head><body>')

const Heading = styled.h1`
  color: red;
`

const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
const jsx = sheet.collectStyles(<Heading>Hello SSR!</Heading>)
const stream = sheet.interleaveWithNodeStream(renderToNodeStream(jsx))

// you'd then pipe the stream into the response object until it's done
stream.pipe(
  res,
  { end: false },
)

// and finalize the response with closing HTML
stream.on('end', () => res.end('</body></html>'))
```

_On the client:_

```js
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom'

hydrate()
// your client-side react implementation
```

After client-side rehydration is complete, styled-components will take over as usual and inject any further dynamic styles after the relocated streaming ones.
