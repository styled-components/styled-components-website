### `.withComponent`

> The `withComponent` API was replaced by [`"as"` prop](#as-polymorphic-prop) in styled-components v4, and fully-removed in v6.

This is a method that creates a new `StyledComponent` with a different tag or component
applied to it, but all the same rules of the one it's called on.

<Table head={['Arguments', 'Description']}>
  <Row>
    <Column>
      1. <Code>component</Code> / <Code>tagname</Code>
    </Column>
    <Column>Either a valid react component or a tagname like `'div'`.</Column>
  </Row>
</Table>

Returns a new `StyledComponent` with the new tag / component being applied when it's used.
