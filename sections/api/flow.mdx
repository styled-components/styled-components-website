## Flow

styled-components has first-class [Flow](https://flowtype.org) support to help
you find typing errors while using our public API.

To use Flow with the public api of styled-components we recommend that you use the library definition in `flow-typed`.
To install it you can use the `flow-typed` cli or download it manually from the git repository and store it in
a `flow-typed/` folder in the same directory with your `flowconfig`.

### Installing the definitions

```
npm i -g flow-typed # if you do not already have flow-typed
flow-typed install styled-components@<version>
```

> If you are on npm >= 5.2 you could simply use [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx)

### Ignore styled-components source

You should add the following lines to your `.flowconfig`, if you run into Flow errors, coming from the styled-components
package in your `node_modules` directory.

```
[ignore]
.*/node_modules/styled-components/.*
```
