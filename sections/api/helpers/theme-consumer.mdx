### `ThemeConsumer` | v4

This is the ["consumer" component](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#consumer) created by `React.createContext` as the companion component to `ThemeProvider`. It uses the [render prop pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) to allow for dynamic access to the theme during rendering.

It passes the current theme (based on a [`ThemeProvider`](/docs/api#themeprovider) higher in your component tree) as an argument to the child function. From this function, you may return further JSX or nothing.

```jsx
import { ThemeConsumer } from 'styled-components'

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeConsumer>
        {theme => <div>The theme color is {theme.color}.</div>}
      </ThemeConsumer>
    )
  }
}
```

> All styled components [automatically receive the theme as a prop](/docs/advanced#theming), so this is only necessary if you wish to access the theme for other reasons.
