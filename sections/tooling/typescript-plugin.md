## TypeScript Plugin

[`typescript-plugin-styled-components`](https://github.com/Igorbek/typescript-plugin-styled-components) is a plugin for TypeScript that gives you a nicer debugging experience.

> ⚠️ TypeScript does not allow to use any plugin or transformer directly from the command line compiler `tsc`. So the plugin only works with build toolchain such as `webpack` with one of TypeScript loaders.

Please refer to [the project's GitHub repo](<(https://github.com/Igorbek/typescript-plugin-styled-components)>) for documentation.
