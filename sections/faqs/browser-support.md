## Which browsers are supported?

styled-components supports the same set of browsers as the current React version.

- v2.x (React v0.14+): IE9+, all evergreen browsers
- v3.x (React v0.14+): IE9+, all evergreen browsers
- v4.x (React v16.3+): IE11, IE 9+ (with Map + Set polyfills), all evergreen browsers
- v5.x (React v16.3+): IE11, all evergreen browsers

Evergreen browsers include Chrome and Firefox (and derivatives) as they can be updated regardless of operating system version. Edge and Safari should both also work fine since all versions for the last several years support the relevant APIs.
