## Why should I avoid declaring styled components in the render method?

By declaring a styled component inside the render method of a react component, you are dynamically creating a new component on every render.
This means that React will have to discard and re-calculate that part of the DOM subtree on each subsequent render, instead of just calculating the difference of what changed between them. This leads to performance bottlenecks and unpredictable behavior.
