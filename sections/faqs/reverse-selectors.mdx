## Can I refer to other components?

Yes! This lets you adopt the "component selector" pattern, which lets components encapsulate the entirety of their styling: as with media queries, it lets components describe how they will behave when affected by external changes, without needing to refer to other parts of your codebase.

Here, our Icon component defines its response to its parent Link being hovered:

```react
const Link = styled.a`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  background: papayawhip;
  color: #BF4F74;
`;

const Icon = styled.svg`
  transition: fill 0.25s;
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;

  ${Link}:hover & {
    fill: rebeccapurple;
  }
`;

const Label = styled.span`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  line-height: 1.2;

  &::before {
    content: "◀";
    margin: 0 10px;
  }
`;

render(
  <Link href="#">
    <Icon viewBox="0 0 20 20">
      <path d="M10 15h8c1 0 2-1 2-2V3c0-1-1-2-2-2H2C1 1 0 2 0 3v10c0 1 1 2 2 2h4v4l4-4zM5 7h2v2H5V7zm4 0h2v2H9V7zm4 0h2v2h-2V7z"/>
    </Icon>
    <Label>Hovering my parent changes my\u00A0style!</Label>
  </Link>
);
```

We could have nested the color-changing rule within our Link component, but then we'd have to consider both sets of rules to understand why Icon behaves as it does.

### Caveat

This behaviour is only supported within the context of _Styled_ Components:
attempting to mount `B` in the following example will fail because component
`A` is an instance of React.Component not a Styled Component.

```tsx
class A extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}

const B = styled.div`
  ${A} {
    color: red;
  }
`
```

The error thrown - `Cannot call a class as a function` - occurs because the
styled component is attempting to call the component as an interpolation function.
