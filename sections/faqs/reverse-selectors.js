const ReverseSelectors = () => md`
  ## Can I refer to other components?

  Yes! This lets you adopt the "Reverse Selector" pattern, which lets components encapsulate the entirety of their styling:
  as with media queries, it lets components describe how they will behave when affected by external changes,
  without needing to refer to other parts of your codebase.

  Here, our Icon component defines its response to its parent Link being hovered:

  \`\`\`react
  const Link = styled.a\`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    background: papayawhip;
    color: palevioletred;
  \`;

  const Icon = styled.svg\`
    transition: fill 0.25s;
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;

    \${Link}:hover & {
      fill: rebeccapurple;
    }
  \`;

  const Label = styled.span\`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    line-height: 1.2;

    &::before {
      content: 'â—€';
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
  \`;

  render(
    <Link href="#">
      <Icon viewBox="0 0 20 20">
        <path d="M10 15h8c1 0 2-1 2-2V3c0-1-1-2-2-2H2C1 1 0 2 0 3v10c0 1 1 2 2 2h4v4l4-4zM5 7h2v2H5V7zm4 0h2v2H9V7zm4 0h2v2h-2V7z"/>
      </Icon>
      <Label>Hovering my parent changes my\u00A0style!</Label>
    </Link>
  );
  \`\`\`

  We could have nested the color-changing rule within our Link component, but then we'd have to
  consider both sets of rules to understand why Icon behaves as it does.

  ### Caveat
  
  This behaviour is only supported within the context of *Styled* Components: 
  attempting to mount \`B\` in the following example will fail because component 
  \`A\` is an instance of React.Component not a Styled Component.

  \`\`\`jsx
  class A extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <div />;
    }
  }
  
  const B = styled.div\`
    \${A} {
    }
  \`;
  \`\`\`

  The error thrown - \`Cannot call a class as a function\` - occurs because the 
  styled component is attempting to call the component as an interpolation function.

export default ReverseSelectors
