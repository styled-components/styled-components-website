## How can I override inline styles?

Inline styles will always take precedence over external CSS, so you cannot override it by simply increasing specificity.

There is a neat trick however, which is to use the style `element-attr` CSS Selector in conjunction with `!important`:

```tsx
const MyStyledComponent = styled(InlineStyledComponent)`
  &[style] {
    font-size: 12px !important;
    color: blue !important;
  }
`
```
